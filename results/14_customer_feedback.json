  "text": "We've been using your project management platform for 8 months now with our team of 45 people. Overall, we're very happy with the product! However, we desperately need a Gantt chart view for our projects. Most of our work involves dependencies between tasks, and the current Kanban view doesn't show these relationships clearly. We're currently using a separate tool just for timeline visualization, which creates extra work and potential sync issues. **Would be great if the feature included:** - Drag-and-drop timeline editing - Dependency arrows between tasks - Resource allocation view - Export to PDF We know several other teams in our company (200+ employees total) who would switch to your platform if this feature existed. **Urgency:** High - considering alternatives if not available in next 6 months **Additional Context:** Happy to beta test if you develop this feature!",
