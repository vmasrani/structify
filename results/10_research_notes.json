  "text": "# Research Notes\n\n**Study:** Impact of Remote Work on Software Developer Productivity\n**Researcher:** Dr. Patricia Wong\n**Date:** October 2024\n**Institution:** Stanford University\n\n## Key Findings\n\nConducted survey of 500 software developers across 50 companies (June-September 2024).\n\n### Productivity Metrics\n\n- 68% reported same or higher productivity when remote\n- Average coding output: +15% compared to office baseline\n- Meeting time reduced by 22% on average\n- Context switching decreased significantly\n\n### Challenges Identified\n\n- Communication delays (mentioned by 45% of respondents)\n- Difficulty onboarding new team members (38%)\n- Reduced spontaneous collaboration (52%)\n\n### Recommendations\n\n1. Implement async-first communication protocols\n2. Schedule focused \"no-meeting\" blocks\n3. Invest in better collaboration tools\n4. Maintain regular team social events\n\n**Next Steps:** Follow-up study in 6 months to track long-term trends.\n\n**References:** See bibliography (23 sources)",
