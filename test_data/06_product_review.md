I've been using these headphones for 3 weeks and I'm really impressed. The sound quality is excellent, especially for electronic music. Battery life is solid - easily 20+ hours on a single charge.

**Pros:**
- Crystal clear audio
- Comfortable for long sessions
- Great active noise cancellation
- USB-C charging

**Cons:**
- A bit pricey at $299
- Bluetooth range could be better

**Would I recommend?** Absolutely, if you're an audiophile willing to invest in quality.
