**Tom:** Thanks for joining us today, Priya. Can you tell us about your experience with microservices?

**Priya:** Absolutely. At my current role at DataTech, I led the migration from a monolith to microservices architecture. We split the system into 12 services using Docker and Kubernetes.

**Sarah:** What were the biggest challenges in that migration?

**Priya:** Definitely handling distributed transactions and maintaining data consistency. We implemented the Saga pattern and used event sourcing for critical workflows.

**Tom:** Impressive. How do you approach system design for high-scale applications?

**Priya:** I always start with understanding the requirements and traffic patterns. Then focus on caching strategies, database sharding, and async processing where appropriate.

**Sarah:** Do you have any questions for us?

**Priya:** Yes, I'd love to know more about your deployment pipeline and what your team culture is like.
