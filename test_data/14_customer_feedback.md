## Feedback

We've been using your project management platform for 8 months now with our team of 45 people. Overall, we're very happy with the product!

However, we desperately need a Gantt chart view for our projects. Most of our work involves dependencies between tasks, and the current Kanban view doesn't show these relationships clearly.

We're currently using a separate tool just for timeline visualization, which creates extra work and potential sync issues.

**Would be great if the feature included:**
- Drag-and-drop timeline editing
- Dependency arrows between tasks
- Resource allocation view
- Export to PDF

We know several other teams in our company (200+ employees total) who would switch to your platform if this feature existed.

**Urgency:** High - considering alternatives if not available in next 6 months

**Additional Context:** Happy to beta test if you develop this feature!
